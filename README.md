# Issues to encounter or bugs :
There are no bugs at the moment. But the API has been breaking in the course of building this website but I managed to finish all the coding, testing and deploying to ghPages. <br> Headsup, this API can break while running the website again, this was unexpected and I should be getting a permanent resolution to it as soon as possible. This is the error; <br> _has been blocked by CORS policy:No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource_ <br>
